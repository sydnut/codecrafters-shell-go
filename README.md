# codecrafters-shell-go
- golang-practice for codecraters' s build your own shell(completely)
- give some references about the solution
- for the reason that I just learn go for not enough a month,there may be some stupid codes,anyway just the thoughts!
- one more importanting is that **no depency for other libs** which could make coding eazier.It's just the fun writing a utility from zero
